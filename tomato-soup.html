            When done well, this age-old combination can be exactly what you need. <br>
            Here, the cooking is as easy sa the eating: While you get the soup started <br>
            in a pot with a can of tomatoes and little more than onion butter (in the <br>
            style of Marcella Hazan's famous tomato sauce), you assemble and pan-fry <br>
            the sandwiches.
